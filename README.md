# HomeNetworkStatus
## For Nest WiFi Router
This code is free to use. It was created to "scratch" another "itch" I had to know when my [Nest WiFi Router](https://store.google.com/product/nest_wifi) was acting up.
While trouble shooting an issue with a Google tech he told me about the [diagnostic endpoint](http://192.168.86.1/api/v1/status) for the Nest Wifi. Yours maybe different.
I found it handy and wanted create an app.
In future versions I will be cleaning up the UI and creating an icon.
